### Part 2 (75 pts)

If a problem is found that would be vital to the security of the company, it should definitely be addressed right away, and told to the boss. If the boss is adamantly against fixing the bug, then the flaw should be shown to people up the chain of command in the company, eventually going to the media if no one in the company deems it to be worth the time. 
 When a security flaw is found, especially by someone inside the organization, it needs to immediately be fixed. If one person can find it, it is only a matter of time that the bug is exploited by an unwanted party. Take for a backdoor that was intentionally left in the Apple iOS back in 2014. It was knowingly left in the software to be used for troubleshooting other problems, however it gave hackers a second way into someone’s iPhone. It could have cost Apple about $300,000 in damage, likely more. Not only that, but the company’s reputation was damaged for many of the months following the discovery. 
Many argue that fixing the bug will cost the company more in time, however if you look at the money saved in a long run, fixing this bug will be worth much more. It will avoid the cost of later having to defend leaving the bug as well as the financial burden that comes with fixing it after the fact. Leaving the bug for the product to come out sooner will end up being much more costly than waiting the six months and fixing it now. 
If after all the explaining using real examples and facts, nothing is fixed, then the company could endure a large law suit, as well as software damage depending on the bug and how it is exploited. However, I would not be responsible as I tried to alert the company. I would also like to insert that I would have tried to fix the bug myself, at least a little.
