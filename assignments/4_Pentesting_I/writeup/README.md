## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

First, I nc'd into the bank server using cd 1337bank.money 1337, which displayed the server information. Next, i found that when I nc into the server, and it asks for a domain, I can add other commands, so I started with doing 1337bank.money;ls which showed me the directories. Next, I was able to go into the home directory using 1337bank.money; cd /home. Here I saw home contained a flag.txt. I could then navigate and open the flag using 1337bank.money;cd /home; cat flag.txt. Below is the flag:

CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}


In order to prevent this in the future, there should be a script implemented that will not allow for input passed a semicolon, or anything that is not after the domain name or ip address. Things could either be blacklisted and not allowed to be executed, or white listed and only read until the end of the domain name or ip address. The line could also be treated as text instead of an executable.
