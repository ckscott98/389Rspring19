## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (45 Pts)

1. 142.93.136.81
2. The attacker did port sniffing and used nmap to scan multiple random ports and find which are open. They then got in through port 21. They also already have the password to log into the server they connect to so I assume they had previously used a dictionary to brute force the password, or social engineering. 
3. The attackers are connecting using the ip address 159.203.113.181 which is from Clifton, New Jersey, USA
4. The attackers got in using port 21 which is FTP.
5. The file the attacker stole was a jpeg image of people on a beach. 
	a. A jpeg file
	b. The picture was taken in Rambla General Jose Artigas, 20100 Punta del Este, Departamento de Maldonado, Uruguay.
	c. The picture was taken on Sun, 23 December 2018 at 05:16:24 PM.
	d. The photo was taken on an iphone8.
	e. The altitude is 4.5726 (I think it is in meters already but I can't find anything that confirms).
6. The file that the attacker left was greetz.fpff
7. To prevent these types of attacks, someone could block ip addresses that begin to check and test every port, as that would be a sign of port scanning. The more well known ports can be moved to higher more random port numbers, making it harder to find an open port.
